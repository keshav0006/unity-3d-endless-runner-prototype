# Unity 3D Endless Runner Game

A simple retro-style 3D endless runner game built in Unity.
The project focuses on procedural floor and obstacle generation
and a continuous gameplay loop rather than visual polish.

## Gameplay Overview
- Player controls a rolling ball in a 3D environment
- Floor and obstacles are generated endlessly
- Press SPACE to jump over obstacles
- Game restarts automatically when the player:
  - Collides with an obstacle
  - Falls off the moving ground

## Core Mechanics
- Procedural floor spawning
- Procedural obstacle generation
- Physics-based jump control
- Collision detection
- Automatic game restart logic

## Tools & Technologies
- Unity (3D)
- C#
- Rigidbody & Colliders
- Procedural generation logic

## Note
This project is a gameplay-focused prototype created to
understand endless runner mechanics. UI, audio, and visual
polish were not the primary focus.
